## Installation

```python
git clone https://github.com/awhitewhale/PAA-2.git
cd PAA-2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
requirements.txt may contain lower versions of Python modules that have already been removed from the PyPI library, but higher versions should also work.

ASR (%), PSNR (dB), SSIM, and NIQE values of various gradient-based attacks in a single normally trained model environment. Adversarial examples
are generated using MI-FGSM, TIM, SIM, VT-FGSM, Admix, and PAM, and our PAA^2 attack methods on Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2,
and Res-101 models. * denotes white-box model. Bolded, Underlined, and Italicized represent the first, second, and third ranked performance, respectively.

Visualization of PAA^2 and PAM for adversarial examples. Here, we randomly selected ten images and generated adversarial examples on Inc-v3. The
variables in parentheses represent the noise types of PAA^2.
